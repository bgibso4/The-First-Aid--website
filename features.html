		<hr>
		<br><h3>Estimated Wait Times</h3>
		Using statistics it estimates the wait time for a patient to see a Doctor/expert. The app will also show the wait times for hospitals nearby allowing you to choose the most logical hospital and let you plan accordingly.<br><br>

		<h3>Filling Out Necessary Information</h3>
		Allowing you to fill out routine information before you arrive at the emergency room.  This would include family doctor information, a list of current medications, your allergies, your current medical conditions, what happened, and any additional notes. This ultimately will allow the nurse to be more thorough while cutting down on time.<br><br>

		<h3>Filling out Prescription on Phone</h3>
		Once the doctor has seen you and determined if a prescription is necessary, the corresponding information regarding the prescription will be loaded onto your phone. You can then send out the prescription to your pharmacy of choice and pick it up at a later time. This feature eliminates the time it takes waiting for the prescription to be filled and prevents you from potentially losing it.<br><br>

		<h3>Alerting Patients who Leave Before Seeing a Doctor</h3>
		It is common for a patient to leave the hospital before they see an expert. For safety reasons sometimes Health Links has to follow up on this and check in on the patient. Using GPS the app will alert the hospital when the patient leaves the premises without seeing an expert.<br><br>

		<h3>Linking Health Card to Application</h3>
		Not everyone is always carrying their health card on them for a wide variety of reasons. Linking their health card to smart phone can help to be more convenient and eliminate confusion.<br><br>

		<h3>Alerting Hospital</h3>
		Alert the specific hospital that you will be arriving and approximately how long.<br><br>
