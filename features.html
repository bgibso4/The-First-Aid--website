					<div class="brief">Alerting Patients who Leave Before Seeing a Doctor</div>
					<div class="description">
						It is common for a patient to leave the hospital before they see an expert. The patient may be leaving for a variety of reasons such as they begin to feel much better than when thery arrived or they are getting fed up with waiting so long. For safety reasons sometimes Health Links has to follow up on this situation and check in on the patient. Using the smartphoneâ€™s GPS the app will alert the hospital and the patient when the patient leaves the premises without seeing an expert. This will tell the patient to return back to the hospital or ask the patient why they left.<br><br>

					<div class="description">
						Once the patient decides the most logical hospital for their situation they can alert the specific hospital that you will be coming there and approximately in how long. Allow you to fill out routine and necessary information before you even arrive at the emergency room.  This would include family doctor information, a list of current medications, your allergies, your current medical conditions, what exactly happened, and any additional notes that the Doctor/Nurse should know. This ultimately will allow the nurse to be more thorough while cutting down on the time needed to assess each patient.<br><br>
