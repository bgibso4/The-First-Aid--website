	<p>

The Universal healthcare system in Canada is amazing but often times can be time consuming.  Everyone has their own unique stories from the hospital. Whether it’s waiting all night to get a broken arm looked at or having a doctor look at a skin infection.<br> <br>


Our mission at The First Aid is to improve the efficiency and simplicity of the healthcare system in Canada both for the patient and the hospital. With the introduction of The First Aid we plan on speeding up the process of visiting the emergency room at hospitals and filling out prescriptions.<br><br>


By cutting the processing time it takes at hospitals we have moved the system towards more of an in and out trip rather than a waiting game filled with paperwork.<br><br>

 
This application is meant to be used for for situations where the Emergency Room is inevitable rather than in life threatening medical emergencies. This could be due to many doctor’s offices closed on weekends and at night and urgent care being required.<br><br>

 
Once you arrive at the hospital it currently takes the Nurse between 8-10 minutes to question and assess each newly arrived patient. This is partially due to the fact that the Nurse has to:<br>


        	<ul>
        		<li>Examine your health card<br></li>
        		<li>Obtain your family doctor information<br></li>
        		<li>Gather a list of current medications, allergies and your current medical conditions<br></li>
        	</ul>

These could all easily be avoided by having the patient filling this information in on their smartphone on their way to the hospital. <br><br>
