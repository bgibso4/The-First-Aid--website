			What Are We
			</h3>
			<div class="description">
			We are a passionate startup team who are focused on improving and simplifying the Canadian Emergency room experience. While the health care system can be complex at times we at The First Aid believe that this does not always have to be the case. With the help of our easy to use application we trust that it will help the patient spend less time waiting at the hospital and more time getting back to living their life.<br><br>

				<h2>Canada's Current Situation</h2>
				The Universal healthcare system in Canada is amazing but often times can be time consuming and a headache.  Everyone has their own unique stories from the Emergency Room. Many of these stories involve non life-threatening situations where an ambulance is not required. These situations can range from waiting all night to get a broken arm looked at or having to go to the hospital on a Saturday morning to have a doctor examine an irregular rash.

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				Our mission at The First Aid is to improve the efficiency and simplicity of the healthcare system in Canada both for the patient and the hospital. With the introduction of The First Aid we plan on speeding up various processes involved with visiting the emergency room at hospitals and help to make the overall Emergency Room process simpler in today’s technology dominated society.  At The First Aid we plan on developing a mobile app compatible with both Android and Iphone that will help simplify the emergency room experience.

				<h2>When to Use It</h2>
				This application is meant to be used for for situations where the Emergency Room is inevitable rather than in life threatening medical emergencies where an ambulance would be necessary. The fact that the emergency room may be unavoidable could be due to many doctor’s offices having limited hours and being closed on weekends but urgent care is still required.

				<td bgcolor= "black" width="40%" valign="bottom">If a patient could fill out this information out on their way to the hospital on their smartphone it would require the nurse less time to see the patient. This would allow the nurse to be more thorough with each patient, all while saving time.

					<h2>Current Procedure</h2>
					Once you arrive at the hospital it currently takes the Nurse 8-10 minutes to question and assess each newly arrived patient. This is partially due to the fact that the Nurse has to:
							<ul>
								<li>Examine your health card</li>
								<li>Obtain your family doctor information</li>
								<li>Gather a list of your current medications, allergies and medical conditions</li>
							</ul>
